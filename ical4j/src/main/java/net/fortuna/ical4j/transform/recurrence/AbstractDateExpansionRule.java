/**
 * Subclasses provide implementations to expand (or limit) a list of dates based on rule requirements as
 * specified in RFC5545.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     3.3.10.  Recurrence Rule
 *
 *       ...
 *
 *       BYxxx rule parts modify the recurrence in some manner.  BYxxx rule
 *       parts for a period of time that is the same or greater than the
 *       frequency generally reduce or limit the number of occurrences of
 *       the recurrence generated.  For example, "FREQ=DAILY;BYMONTH=1"
 *       reduces the number of recurrence instances from all days (if
 *       BYMONTH rule part is not present) to all days in January.  BYxxx
 *       rule parts for a period of time less than the frequency generally
 *       increase or expand the number of occurrences of the recurrence.
 *       For example, "FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1,2" increases the number of
 *       days within the yearly recurrence set from 1 (if BYMONTH rule part
 *       is not present) to 2.
 *
 *       If multiple BYxxx rule parts are specified, then after evaluating
 *       the specified FREQ and INTERVAL rule parts, the BYxxx rule parts
 *       are applied to the current set of evaluated occurrences in the
 *       following order: BYMONTH, BYWEEKNO, BYYEARDAY, BYMONTHDAY, BYDAY,
 *       BYHOUR, BYMINUTE, BYSECOND and BYSETPOS; then COUNT and UNTIL are
 *       evaluated.
 *
 *       The table below summarizes the dependency of BYxxx rule part
 *       expand or limit behavior on the FREQ rule part value.
 *
 *       The term "N/A" means that the corresponding BYxxx rule part MUST
 *       NOT be used with the corresponding FREQ value.
 *
 *       BYDAY has some special behavior depending on the FREQ value and
 *       this is described in separate notes below the table.

 *
 *       Note 1:  Limit if BYMONTHDAY is present; otherwise, special expand
 *                for MONTHLY.
 *
 *       Note 2:  Limit if BYYEARDAY or BYMONTHDAY is present; otherwise,
 *                special expand for WEEKLY if BYWEEKNO present; otherwise,
 *                special expand for MONTHLY if BYMONTH present; otherwise,
 *                special expand for YEARLY.
